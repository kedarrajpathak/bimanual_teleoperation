detect and track poses of two cubes
the cubes have aruco markers on all 6 sides
for a cube of side 1
    the origin is at (0.5,0.5,0.5)
    z axis is from (0.5,0.5,0.5) to (0,0,0) or from (0.5,0.5,0.5) to (1,1,1)
    x and y axis are perpendicular to each other and the z axis


features to include:
    detect the aruco markers
    estimate the poses of detected markers
    assign the detected marker poses to left_hand or right_hand group
        left_hand markers: 0 to 5 from DICT_4X4_50, marker size 40mm
        right_hand markers: 6 to 11 from DICT_4X4_50, marker size 40mm
    estimate the origin frame of cube from the detected aruco markers on cube surfaces
    track the cube poses for each group using kalman filter
    publish the tracked poses as PoseStamped messages


There exists a unique transform between a detected marker and the origin of the cube. 
So there are in total 6 transforms for 6 sides of the cube.
Depending on which marker is detected use the corresponding transform to estimate cube origin.
